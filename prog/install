Tissue Simulation Toolkit, v0.1.1

Welcome to the Tissue Simulation Toolkit, a library for
two-dimensional simulations of Glazier and Graner's Cellular Potts
model (Glazier and Graner, 1993).

The TST aims to provide a simple set of computational tools to get you
started with Cellular Potts Simulations.

The current version of the TST includes example programs for the
following published simulations:

- Differential adhesion driven cell sorting (Glazier and Graner, 1993)
- Cell elongation dependent vasculogenesis (blood vessel growth)
(Merks et al., 2006) 
- Contact-inhibition dependent vasculogenesis
and angiogenesis (Merks and Glazier, 2005; Merks and Glazier, 2006;
Merks et al, arxiv:q-bio.TO/050533)

The TST provides many recent extensions to the CPM, including

- Infinite number of PDE layers (forward Euler)
- Interaction of CPM cells and PDE (secretion, absorption)
- Chemotaxis
- Length and connectivity constraints

and visualization of:

- Cells, according to cell type or anything you wish
- Chemical fields, using color ramps and contour lines (level sets)


INSTALLATION
------------
The TST has been compiled on Windows XP (minGW) and Linux systems (GNU
C++). The following libraries are required:

Qt (version 3 or 4)
libpng (url) and libz (url)

For Unix, we also have an X11-only version, although compilation is
easiest with the qmake tool shipped with Qt (see
http://www.trolltech.com)

With Qt, simply type:

qmake
make

If you want to use a different "main" program (examples are given:
vessel.cpp and sorting.cpp), just change "TARGET" in the file
"CellularPotts2.pro".


EXAMPLE PROGRAMS
----------------
A small Cellular Potts tutorial making use of the example programs
sorting.cpp and vessel.cpp is provide by the document "exercises.pdf".


DOCUMENTATION
-------------
An automatically generated class documentation is included in html/index.html.

A tutorial on CPM programming is unfortunately available, but I will
try to write it in the future.
